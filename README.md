# x1yoga-scripts
A possibly-temporary collection of scripts to get my X1 Yoga working the way I'd like.

A very *small* collection, currently just a script that enables backlight control on the X1 Yoga (adapted from a solution on the arch linux wiki: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Backlight )
